********** Infrared (IR) Car by Tim Nguyen **********

The IR Car uses an Arduino Nano Micro-Controller and Infrared (IR) Emitters and Receivers to run along a black line on a white background, outputting LED signals as it goes. It will also stop at a straight black finish line.

LED Signals:
	Green		if GO
	Red		if RIGHT TURN
	Blue		if LEFT TURN
	Red+Blue	if STOP
